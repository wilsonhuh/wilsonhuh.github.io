<p>You are CIA. You are smart, handsome, and by far the most talented man on your team. <br>
You are in charge because you are the one who gets things done. 
<p>

<p>
You are here in Uzbekistan to escort nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel to safety via airplane. <br>
The local militia was kind enough to drop off not only Dr. Pavel, but three enemy mercenaries—now prisoners—who had tried to capture your man. <br>
After learning that they work for the notorious terrorist Bane, you load the hooded and bound men aboard your aircraft for interrogation. <br>
You are not about to let this golden opportunity slip by.
