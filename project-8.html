<p>​WARNING: Contains cartoon blood and gore </p>

<p>​This is a wordless story featuring original art and animation. Click the image to proceed through the story. This project mainly served as a means for me to learn animation. I combined this with HTML to create net art. My goal with this sequence is to raise questions within the viewer. The setting is vague, the main character is silent, and there is no narration whatsoever. Hopefully, viewers will wonder why the character is acting this way, but I will be satisfied if I can simply entertain the viewer with these animations.

	These scenes are drawn in a pixel art style because I made these assets with the intention of using them for an independent video game someday. In a way, I want to give viewers the sense that they are controlling the character. With every click, viewers assist in carrying out the enigmatic whims of the witch. They may not like the result, but they are responsible for moving the scene forward. If I had more time, I would have implemented some degree of player choice to make this idea more apparent.
