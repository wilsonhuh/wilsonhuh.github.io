<b><i>RE: Reaction Videos</i>, Digital Video, 3min 26sec, 2019</b>
<br><br>
<p>This video is a response to the increasingly popular genre of content known as "reaction videos" which feature one or more people reacting to other video content.
 <br> In my work, I explore the widespread obsession with online reaction videos for the purpose of poking fun at both uploaders and viewers.</p>

<b><i>Waterfall Beat</i>, Digital Video, 2min 28sec, 2019</b>
<br><br>
This piece portrays a martial artist diligently training in a serene landscape. <br>
Her karate techniques exude a tangible rhythm. This is a fighter's dedication to her craft. <br>
This video is meant to be projected onto the entirety of a large indoor wall and looped nonstop. <br>

<b><i>Drive Dive</i>, Interactive Net Art, 2019</b>
<br><br>
<p>This is an interactive experience composed of images, gifs, and video clips I had saved
to my hard drive over the years. <br>
Thorough exploration of the site will yield some hidden pages.</p>
<p>The featured video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFF7iXTJKcU" target="_blank">Vintage AniMemes</a> is a remix/mashup I made using found footage dating back to around 2010.</p>

<b><i>Digital Me</i>, Interactive Net Art, 2019</b>
<br><br>
<p>This project showcases my tendencies and thought processes through recorded footage of me playing video games.<br>
I condensed several hours of my gameplay into a montage of my favorite clips. <br>
Each page is dedicated to a character I play with descriptions and examples to provide insight into my mind. <br>
This is why I love video games.</p>

<b>ARTIST STATEMENT</b>

<br>
<br>

I primarily use digital media both to shape and present my work. <br>
Examples of my projects include image and video editing, animation, HTML, 3D printing, etc. <br>
As someone who grew up using computers, expressing myself through them is second nature to me. <br>
I work in digital media as a means to get closer to my goal: creating an independent video game that I can be proud of. 
<br>
<br>
Programs that I use to create my art include Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Dreamweaver. <br>
I often incorporate images I found online into my projects. <br>
This can be seen in my project "Drive Dive," which aims to give viewers a fun and engaging experience. <br>
In this work, I took measures to make certain elements interactive and enjoyable to explore. <br>
This is the kind of mindset I would want to bring to my future game projects.
